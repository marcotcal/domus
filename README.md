Home Automation 

The main goal of this project is to create a system for the automation of my home and at the same time have some fun and pass the time on weekends.
I don't want to be tied to established commercial protocols and systems. Of course I won't develop anything related to speech recognition because I know my limits :). 

I may in the future interface with some commercial system for speech recognition (it will be a good exercise to learn) but this is not a priority.
